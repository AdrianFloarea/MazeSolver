# MazeSolver
Java implementation of the Solving Maze algorithm presented by Computerphile.

This project is inspired by the maze solving algorithm from Computerphile (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI).
It is a Dijkstra implementation.

I was able to process mazes up to 6k by 6k.

To run, start MazeSolver.jar and choose a file from the 'mazes' folder.
Processing larger mazes takes longer.
